<h4>Volunteered in National Service Scheme(NSS)</h4>
<div>NSS gave us opportunity to visit nearby villages of IIT Kanpur. We organised 8-weeks teaching program for rural kids in which we taught 'Basics of Computer' to them. I published articles on behalf of Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, IIT Kanpur. Moreover, a team of IITK students including me have taken government scheme surveys in Pratappur Hari village.<div>
